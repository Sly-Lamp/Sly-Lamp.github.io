          <h1>Location: Sprawling Shade City<br>	
            Year: 2022<br><br>
            You are a ‘Soldier-For-Hire’ with a mysterious past, known as 'Torbo<br> Dandrio'. You have been tasked with hunting down a scientist whom, up<br> until recently, had been working for the infamous tech giant,<br> 'SHADY-INC'. The Scientist is 'Doctor Redfield Herring'. He has been<br> creating human/robot hybrids known as 'THE FODDER.’ SHADY-INC had been<br> planning to market and sell the “FODs” as the ‘perfect automated<br> servants to the human population’.<br>
            <br>
            But… much to everyone’s complete surprise, the ‘Distinguished Doctor<br> Redfield’ is actually ‘THE MAD DOCTOR HERRING!’ He has secretly been<br> programming his synthetic army to carry out his evil bidding. He intends to create a “New World” type situation using his diabolical creations, according to his recently ‘uncovered’ manifesto, says the reputable online news outlet, ‘SHADY-INFO.COM’.<br>
            <br>
            You must infiltrate 'SHADY HQ', gather intel, dispatch THE FODDER in whatever way you deem necessary, and finally …dead or alive… you must stop the Mad Doctor, who is currently working on his LATEST CREATION on the 5th floor of SHADY HQ! Good luck!”
